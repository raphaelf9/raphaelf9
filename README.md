### Hello 👋
- I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer.

- 🏢 I believe that science and technology can make the world a better place! Learning and seeking solutions are great motivations in my life.

- ⚙️ I have worked in several areas since the beginning of my degree at the Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP), with technologies involving computer networks, software development, embedded electronics, and laboratory automation with In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) equipment.

- 🌱 After graduating in industrial mechatronics, I specialized in software engineering, focusing on web development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUCMinas).

- 🔭 My interest in technology covers several areas, but they all converge towards problem-solving and continuous improvement.
