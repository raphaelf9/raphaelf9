### Hi there 👋

 - I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer.

 - 🏢 I believe that science and technology can make the world a better place!
Learning and seeking solutions are great motivations in my life.

- ⚙️ I worked in several areas since the beginning of my graduation at the Federal Institute of São Paulo - IFSP,
with technologies involving computer networks, software development, embedded electronics and laboratory automation with In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) equipment.

- 🌱 After graduating, I'm majoring in software engineering, with a focus on
web development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais - PUCMinas.

- 🔭 My interest in technology encompasses many different areas but all converge on problem solving and continuous improvement.

- Feel free to contact me to teach me something, ask questions or advice.
